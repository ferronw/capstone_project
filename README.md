Alright here is the first version with the most barely functional features

Basic flow to how the app works:

from the main menu, press create level 
press select photo
select target image from gallery
press generate level
click once on screen to set player spawn
click again to set goal position
click the up left hand corner to rotate the image to desired functionality
then click upper right hand corner to generate the level
wait for that to process, it will automatically spit you out to the main menu
generated level is stored as "level_output.txt" in files directory of app data
press go to game
navigate green rectangle to the flag, press grey rectangles to go left or right, grey square to jump
